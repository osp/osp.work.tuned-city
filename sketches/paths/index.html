                Jonathan Burrows contextualizes the interview in 2011: “The
                memory is very clear of Myriam talking with me about The Stop
                Quartet and Both Sitting Duet. The conversation challenged me
                to attempt to articulate what it was that I thought I was
                doing: why I wanted to work in this way with rhythm and
                counterpoint, and how I was thinking about materials and
                performance. My feeling re-reading the interview is that I was
                struggling to make sense of what was in my mind, and I think
                I’ve said it perhaps more clearly since, but the talk provoked
                a particular line of questioning which stays relevant for me
                even now.”

                Matteo Fargion assisted Burrows in making the score for The
                Stop Quartet. One of the other musical collaborators for that
                piece, Kevin Volans, had introduced them to a scored way of
                working by Shobana Jeyasingh, a South Indian choreographer,
                based in London, who previously worked with Volans. Burrows is
                interested in Jeyasinghs method to use graph pahper, but when
                trying to compose in a similar way he “ran into a mess” and
                with the help of Matteo he then used another related notational
                system based on an African method of notating rhythm systems.
